## How does it work?

To get started, first create a problemset. When adding an album cover logo, it's best to have a resolution of at least 512x512 and to use common image formats such as JPG, JPEG, or PNG.


## Adding Problems

After an problemset is created you will then be able to add/upload problems.


## My Problems

Once problems are added to an problemset you are then able to solve, favorite, and delete them.


## Searching

You can also search for problemset using the search feature at the top of every page. Any relevant problemsets will appear at the top of the results page, and the results for individual problems will appear below.
